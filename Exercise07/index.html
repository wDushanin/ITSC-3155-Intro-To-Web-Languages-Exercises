<!--Assignment Description: 
    Create an index.html page and copy in the following HTML and JavaScript code into the body tag. Launch the 
    page and observe the page behavior. Now, go through the JavaScript code and add a comment above every line, 
    explaining in your own words what it does to the best of your ability. It is alright if you are not completely
    correct, you will still get credit if we see that you have made a good attempt.
