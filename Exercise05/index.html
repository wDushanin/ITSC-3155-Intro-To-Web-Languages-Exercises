<!--Assignment Description: 
Create two HTML pages, "index.html" and "about.html". Give a title to the "index.html" page that says "Home Page" 
nd include a link to the about page. On the about page, give it a title that says "About Page" and write some text 
(it can be random lorem text like above) and a link to the home page. Your page does not have to look exactly like 
this example, as long as the links back and forth work.
